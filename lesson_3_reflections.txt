Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: When I want to share the files with other people. Or access the files from 2 or more computers.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: I can choose when to pull my changes which gives me more control over the process.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A: A fork is a remote copy of a remote repository. A clone is a local copy of a remote repository. A branch
   is a separate section of files within a local repository.

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A: So that you can make off-line changes.
